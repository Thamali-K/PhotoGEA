\title{Calculate leakiness}

\description{
  Calculates leakiness (\code{phi}) from combined gas exchange and isotope
  discrimination measurements as described in Ubierna et al. (2013). This
  function can accomodate alternative colum names for the variables taken from
  \code{exdf_obj}; it also checks the units of each required column and will
  produce an error if any units are incorrect.

\details{
  This function uses the comprehensive model for photosynthetic discrimination
  against 13C in C3 plants, as described in Ubierna et al. (2018). In
  particular, the following equations from that source are implemented in the

  This function uses the model for photosynthetic discrimination against 13C in
  C4 plants to determine leakiness values, as described in Ubierna et al.
  (2013). In particular, the following equations from that source are
  implemented in the code:

  \itemize{
    \item Isotopic fractionation due to day respiration (\code{e_prime}) is
          calculated using Equation 21.
    \item Leakiness including respiratory and photorespiratory fractionations
          under high light (\code{phi_i}) is calculated using Equation 16.
    \item Leakiness including respiratory and photorespiratory fractionations
          and Cs under high light (\code{phi_is}) is calculated using Equation
          15.
    \item Leakiness ignoring respiratory and photorespiratory fractionations and
          Cs (\code{phi_sim}) is calculated using Equation 17.
