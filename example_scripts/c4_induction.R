# This script loads Licor data representing C4 induction curves from multiple
# Excel files, combines it into one data structure and computes averages across
# multiple reps for each event in the data.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT LICOR EXCEL FILES: by default, Licor Excel files do not
# `calculate` formula values. This causes a problem when reading them in R,
# since any data entry determined from a formula will be read as 0. To fix this
# issue for a Licor Excel file, open it in in Excel, go to the `Formulas` menu,
# and choose `Calculate Now`. (Alternatively, press F9.) Then save the file and
# close it. See https://github.com/tidyverse/readxl/issues/495 for more details.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This script is broken up into several sections to make it easier to use:
# - Components that might need to change each time this script is run
# - Components that are less likely to change each time this script is run
# - Functions used to load and process the data (shouldn't need to change)
# - The commands that actually call the functions
#
# Typically, it should only be necessary to specify the names of input files.
# This information is specified in the LICOR_FILES_TO_PROCESS vector. By
# default, these file names are chosen interactively via a dialog box (only
# available on MS Windows).
#
# Alternatively, the filenames can be specified directly as relative or absolute
# paths. In the case of relative paths, they should be specified relative to the
# directory that contains this script.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# To run the script, set the R working directory to the directory that contains
# this script and type:
#
# source('c4_induction.R')
