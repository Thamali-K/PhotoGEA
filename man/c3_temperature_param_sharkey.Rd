\format{
  List with 9 named elements that each represent a variable whose
  temperature-dependent value can be calculated using the Arrhenius equation:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{Kc}: The Michaelis-Menten constant for rubisco carboxylation.
    \item \code{Ko}: The Michaelis-Menten constant for rubisco oxygenation.
    \item \code{Gamma_star}: The value of CO2 partial pressure in the
          chloroplast at which no assimilation occurs in the absence of
          respiration.
    \item \code{Vcmax_norm}: The maximum rate of rubisco carboxylation
          (\code{Vcmax}) normalized to its value at 25 degrees C.
    \item \code{J_norm}: The electron transport rate (\code{J}) normalized to
          its value at 25 degrees C.
    \item \code{RL_norm}: The respiration rate (\code{RL}) normalized to its
          value at 25 degrees C.
    \item \code{gmc_norm}: The mesophyll conductance (\code{gmc}) normalized to
          its value at 25 degrees C.
    \item \code{Tp_norm}: The maximum rate of triose phosphate utilization
          (\code{Tp}) normalized to its value at 25 degrees C.
  }

  The \code{gmc_norm} and \code{Tp_norm} parameters are calculated using
  Johnson-Eyring-Williams functions, and hence their elements are lists with 4
  named elements:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{type}: the type of temperature response (\code{'Johnson'})
    \item \code{c}: the (dimensionless) scaling factor.
    \item \code{Ha}: the enthalpy of activation in \code{kJ / mol}.
    \item \code{Hd}: the enthalpy of deactivation in \code{kJ / mol}.
    \item \code{S}: the entropy in \code{kJ / K / mol}.
    \item \code{units}: the units of the corresponding variable.
  }

  Each of the other parameters is calculated using an Arrhenius response, so
  each remaining element is itself a list with 4 named elements:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{type}: the type of temperature response (\code{'Arrhenius'})
    \item \code{c}: the (dimensionless) Arrhenius scaling factor.
    \item \code{Ea}: the activation energy in \code{kJ / mol}.
    \item \code{units}: the units of the corresponding variable.
  }
}

  Some of these parameters (\code{RL}, \code{Vcmax}, \code{J}, \code{Tp}, and
  \code{gmc}) are normalized to their values at 25 degrees C. These variables
  include \code{_norm} in their names to indicate this.

  The remaining parameters (\code{Gamma_star}, \code{Kc}, and \code{Ko}) are not
  normalized because they are assumed to not vary significantly between species.

  Response parameters were obtained from Sharkey et al. (2007). In this
  publication, gas concentrations are expressed as partial pressures (in
  \code{Pa} or \code{kPa}) rather than mole fractions (\code{micromol / mol} or
  \code{mmol / mol}). However, for consistency with
  \code{\link{c3_temperature_param_bernacchi}}, here we prefer to use mole
  fractions.

  To convert a concentration expressed as a partial pressure (\code{P}; in
  \code{Pa}) to a concentration expressed as a mole fraction (\code{C}; in
  \code{micromol / mol}), we need a value for atmospheric pressure; we will use
  the typical value of \code{101325 Pa}. Then \code{C = P / 101325 * 1e6} or
  \code{C = P * cf}, where \code{cf = 1e6 / 101325} is a conversion factor. The
  same correction can be used to convert \code{kPa} to \code{mmol / mol}. The
  value of \code{cf} can be accessed using \code{PhotoGEA:::c_pa_to_ppm}.
