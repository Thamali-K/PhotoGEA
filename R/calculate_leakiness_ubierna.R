  # Correct the value of CO2_s to account for the "dilution effect" that occurs
  # because of leaf transpiration. From the Licor LI-6400 manual: "This is a
  # correction we donâ€™t do, at least when computing CO2 concentration in the
  # LI-6400. The dilution effect is simply this: as you add molecules of a
  # gas (water vapor, for example) to a mixture, the fraction of that mixture
  # that is made up of something else (mole fraction of CO2, for instance) has
  # to decrease, since the total number of molecules in the mixture has
  # increased. Now for an airsteam flowing though a chamber containing a
  # transpiring leaf (or in a chamber sitting on moist soil), there very
  # definitely is dilution. However, we ignore that effect when computing CO2
  # concentration, but account for it when computing photosynthetic rate (or
  # soil CO2 efflux). Thus, the LI-6400 IRGA is always indicating the actual CO2
  # concentration, not what the CO2 concentration would be if there were no
  # water vapor in it."

  # chamber and Co is the mol fraction of CO2 leaving the leaf chamber. When
  # using a Licor, the reference chamber values represent the air entering the
  # leaf chamber and the sample chamber values represent the air leaving the
