    # Correct CO2_s and CO2_r to account for the "dilution effect" that
    # occurs because of leaf transpiration. From the Licor LI-6400 manual: "This
    # is a correction we donâ€™t do, at least when computing CO2 concentration in
    # the LI-6400. The dilution effect is simply this: as you add molecules of a
    # gas (water vapor, for example) to a mixture, the fraction of that mixture
    # that is made up of something else (mole fraction of CO2, for instance) has
    # to decrease, since the total number of molecules in the mixture has
    # increased. Now for an airsteam flowing though a chamber containing a
    # transpiring leaf (or in a chamber sitting on moist soil), there very
    # definitely is dilution. However, we ignore that effect when computing CO2
    # concentration, but account for it when computing photosynthetic rate (or
    # soil CO2 efflux). Thus, the LI-6400 IRGA is always indicating the actual
    # CO2 concentration, not what the CO2 concentration would be if there were
    # no water vapor in it."

    # xsi = Ce / (Ce - Co), where Ce is the mol fraction of CO2 entering the
    # leaf chamber and Co is the mol fraction of CO2 leaving the leaf chamber.
    # When using a Licor, the reference chamber values represent the air
    # entering the leaf chamber and the sample chamber values represent the air
    # leaving the leaf chamber. Note that the CO2 concentrations are measured by
    # the Licor and the TDL, so there are two ways to calculate xsi.

    # reference chambers. Note that there are two options for calculating
