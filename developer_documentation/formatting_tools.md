## Formatting Tools

### EditorConfig

`PhotoGEA` uses [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) to ensure consistent
formatting across text files. EditorConfig provides a method for standardizing
settings across different text editors. The settings themselves are stored in
the `.editorconfig` file in the `PhotoGEA` repository's root directory. While
some editors have native support, others require a plugin. See the
[EditorConfig website](https://editorconfig.org/) for more details.
